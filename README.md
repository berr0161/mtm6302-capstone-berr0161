Proyect- Pok√©dex

Part-2
I wanted to do a easy to guide design. I was inspired by the pokedex of the game pokemon platinum for nintendo 3Ds. Using a game emulator for the pc I was able to acces it. I also used gradients so it looked more modern and dynamic. The buttons were also inspired in the simple design the used on the Gameboy games with red pokemon.
