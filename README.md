Part-2
I wanted to do a easy to guide design. I was inspired by the pokedex of the game pokemon platinum for nintendo 3Ds. Using a game emulator for the pc I was able to acces it. I also used gradients so it looked more modern and dynamic. The buttons were also inspired in the simple design the used on the Gameboy games with red pokemon.

Part-3

First a created an HTML and css to achieve my prototype. I wanted to work on the javascript on the javascript file to bring the pokemons form the api rather than doing 1 by one in HTML. I wanted to take the challenge for this page specificly and eventually in Capstone project part 4, use java script to bring the information of the pokemons on the second page and use the other elements we have learned such as the addEventListener.

For the Javascript file, I created a function that brings me the first 20 pokemons directly from the poke api, and then on the HTML push I specified all the information I wanted from the poke api based on my design, which is the pokemon number, pokemon name, pokemon image, and the type. This funcion will create kind of a container of each pokemon (the first 20) with the elements I mentioned previously, and then I edited in the Css. I wanted to add the 0 number before each pokemon nomber, I did some research on my own and I found out about a function that could add a number if 0 based on an if and else.

One of the challenges I faced was doing the pokemon statistics on the second page, I didn't really now how to create it in html or css, neither javascript. I started watching youtube tutorials about people creating progress bars with JavaScript, and that helped me create me a funcion with a for,if and else based on the number of bars I wanted to be in a certain color, and eveuntually added a height in css becuase there is no content so with the height they won't dissapear

Another Challenge that I faced was puting the background Color, which in my design is a gradient. However, for some reason it was overlapping, compared when I put a solid color, it worked normal, so I decided to leave a solid color for now. Something really curuios is that the gradients did work on the other parts of my design, like the little containers.

Once I had everything in my html and the javascript that brings me the stats and the pokemons, I started styling for mobile placing everything in A column. Eventually adding media queries, another challenge was that on the second page I placed the pokemon number on top of the container info, So I decided to put it under the pokemon image and eventually work with grid areas so it was easier to asign which area was gonna by occpied by each element.
